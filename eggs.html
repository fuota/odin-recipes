        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Â½ tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 dill pickle, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pickle juice</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 carrot, cut into rounds</li>
            <li>12 slices canned black olives, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice through the top 1/3 of each egg, ensuring some 
                of the yolk is included in the slice. Carefully remove the 
                egg yolk from the bottom portion of the egg using a spoon
                 and transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li> Mix egg yolks, mayonnaise, mustard, pickle, horseradish, 
                pickle juice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Fill a piping 
                bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped with the egg yolk mixture. 
                Pipe egg yolk mixture into the hollowed egg whites creating the 'chick', 
                ensuring there is enough filling to add 'eyes' and a 'beak.' </li>
            <li>Slice small wedges out of the carrot rounds creating 12 'beaks'. Add a 'beak' to each 'chick'. </li>
            <li> Slice olive pieces into small squares to be used as 'eyes.' Add 2 'eyes' to each 'chick.' Place the 
                egg tops onto each 'chick' to look like a chick peaking out of the egg. </li>
    </ol>
